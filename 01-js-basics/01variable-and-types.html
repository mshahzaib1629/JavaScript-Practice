/* 
Naming variables, some important points/rules
    1. Use meaningful names. Avoid using a, b, x, etc. for variable names
    2. Do not start with number
    3. Do not use space or -
    4. Use camel notation for multiword names e.g. firstName. not first_name or first-name
    5. Do not use reserve words e.g. if, else, var, let, function etc.
    6. Variable names are case sensitive in JS
*/

/* Constants
Use const keyword before declaring and initializing the variable
You can't change the value of constant, it would generate an error
*/

const universityName = "CUI";
universityName = "CIIT";
console.log(universityName);


/* There are two types of variables
    1. Primitive types - already defined. basic types.
    2. Reference types - we can define our own too

List of primitive types
    1. string
    2. number
    3. boolean
    4. undefined
    5. null

Reference types
    1. objects
    2. functions

Concept of Literal - specifying value in code of some variable */

// Variables can be declared in JS using 'let' keyword
// We can initlize the variables at the time of declaration or later
// Using a non initialized variable, would print 'undefined' as value

let name = "Asif Shahzad";
let email = 'asifsh7@gmail.com';

let age = 20;
let height = 5.9;
let isGraduate = true;
let universityName;
let cityName = null;
let schoolName = undefined;

// In above code, "Asif Shahzad", 20, true, and null are string literal, number literals ..
// 'undefined' can also be used as literal, but we rarely do so
// In JS, there is no separate type for floating point numbers
// we can print values and types, as shown below

console.log(name);
console.log(age);
console.log(height);
console.log(isGraduate);
console.log(universityName);
console.log(cityName);

console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof age);
console.log(typeof height);
console.log(typeof isGraduate);
console.log(typeof universityName);
console.log( typeof cityName);

// notice, 'undefined' is also a value and type
// you can change the type of a variable by assigning some other value
// concept of: static-type and dynamic-type languages
