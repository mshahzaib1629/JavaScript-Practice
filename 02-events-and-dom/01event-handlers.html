<h1> Event Driven Programming</h1>

<!-- You can attach a JavaScript file name.js or add script directly inside a page -->
<!-- example.js is javascript file, it can be attached with the page as follows: -->
<!-- <script src="example.js" type="text/javascript"></script> -->

<script>

/*
Using JavaScript, we mainly do 5 things:

    1. Change current HTML elements'
    2. Change CSS properties of HTML elements
    3. Add new elements in current page
    4. Interact with server
    5. Implement custom logic e.g. validation, event handling, etc. 


There are 4 things in event driven programming, that you must understand and differentiate:

    1. Component - that fires the event e.g. button, link, text field, image, option list
    2. Event     - e.g. click, double click, mouse over, etc.   
    3. Handler   - the set of instructions that shall execute when the event triggers or fire
    4. Binding   - the processing linking Handler with Event and Component

    Its very important to understand, when we define handlers and do binding, the handler is 
    not executed at that time. The handler execute when the event occur.

    How the event is fired?
        1. When user do something. For example, when user click on some component, the click evet fire.
        2. We can fire the event programmatically too e.g. using Javascript.        
*/

    // Different type of pop-up boxes. We rarely use them in real project, but you should know them.

    // alert("Just an alert Pop-up box");
    // var isContinue = confirm("Do you want to continue? ");
    // console.log("isContinue value = ", isContinue);

    // var userName = prompt("Please input your name: ");
    // console.log("User Name = ", userName);    

</script>

<style>input {margin-bottom: 20px; display: block} </style>

writing the value of onclick property is binding. we are binding some JavaScript code to be executed
when click event is fired. The value of on* functions is the 'Event Handler' must be valid JavaScript code.

<input type="button" onclick="alert('sayHello button pressed');" value="Say Hello"/>

<input type="button" onclick="eventHandler();" value="Call JavaScript Method"/>

<input type="button" onclick="sayHelloByName('Ali');" value="We can pass arguments to event handlers"/>

<input type="button" onclick="changeStyleAndContents();" value="Change Style and Color"/>

<div style="background-color: #bb3902;color: white;font-size: 22px" id="widget1">
    Here comes some text.
</div>

<script>

    // Functions can be bound with events, see below. 
    // this method is associated with onclick event

    function eventHandler() {
        alert("A button is pressed");
        var n = 60;
        console.log(n);
    }
        
    function sayHelloByName(name) {
        alert("Hello " + name);
    }
    
    function getText() {
        return 'Don\'t waste time thinking what you should do, \
        you already know what you should be doing right now.';
    }

    // we can fetch elements and change their properties

    function changeStyleAndContents() {        
        var div1 = document.getElementById('widget1');
        div1.style.color = "Yellow";

        div1.style.backgroundColor = "BLACK";
        div1.innerHTML = getText();
    }
